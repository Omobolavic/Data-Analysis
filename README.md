Introduction
In 2019, 35% of new Canadian immigrants chose to settle in the City of Toronto. The City has 140 neighbourhoods, so, as a new immigrant, a vital question to answer is “What neighbourhood do I settle in?”. The aim of this project is to group Toronto neighborhoods in order of desirability using Machine Learning and Data Visualization techniques. I performed my analysis using on the following criteria:

Total number of Essential Venues in each neighbourhood
Primary and Secondary Benchmarks: Primary benchmarks considered were Unemployment rate, Crime rate and COVID-19 rates while the Secondary benchmark was housing price for a one-bedroom apartment in each neighbourhood.
